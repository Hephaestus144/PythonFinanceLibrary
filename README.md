# Python Peculiarities
1. Poor support for multiple constructors.
1. You have to explicitly overload a function with the `@overload` decorator.
1. Until Python 3.10 there was no switch/case statement.
1. The absence of a terse ternary operator.
1. The absence of private class members.
1. Creating class properties is complex (and then read only properties still rely on convention i.e. they are not explicitly enforced by the interpreter).
